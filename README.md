#First README

####README exercise for Epicodus (10/10/16)

####By Erica Nafziger

##This README exercise is allowing me to practice how to correctly set up a README file.

_I want users and developers to know that this README is pretty neat and I'm not exactly sure what else to do._

##Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Step 1: Open this file_
* _Step 2: You already did it hooray_
* _Step 3: Now read this file from beginning to end_
* _Step 4: Move on with your life_

_This is not an app it is simple a file. It probably doesn't even need a README, but I made one anyway. Hoorah._

##Known Bugs

_There are no known issues...hopefully ever._

##Support and contact details

_If you have any issues or questions contact Erica Nafziger._

##Technologies Used

_I have used Atom, Git, and learnhowtoprogram.com to create this file._
